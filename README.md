# TEMP5-ML&AI
# Testing Environment of Manufacturing Platform for ML and AI


## This Project is a platform for make application  with simple  GUI  and developable application 
### you can use python source code , database and Machine learning algorithms together in one place

Start from the beginning with your own and others' codes

Introduction
===========
This is a new idea to create an application and development based on the graphical user interface and the communication 
between components, you can start the design from scratch and for any time, any situation, any condition,
with or without others, to your taste. change it. You can also develop and test your own code using your own 
machine learning algorithm codes on your own data and other datasets. 
If you help us, this whole project can be changed to another computer language, another GUI, other options and tools, etc.


Start
-----
Befor Use Project ensure that ``python 3.7+`` and ``wxpython`` package install on your system .  
you can see requirement package in file text But if you add a Model for share with other must say to all  
this project start from scerach if you like use Database engain same as MySQL or Oracel ... please install package you need  
and if you like use from other package like SQLalchemy Please send us request


Installation
------------


Appearance of the application
-----------------------------

---------------------
  * Menu and Menubar  
     you can create , edit and delete [Menu Bar](docs/Help/MenuBar.md) and [Menu Item](docs/Help/MenuItem.md)
     Also you can Create [Sub Menu](docs/Help/SubMenu.md) as same as Menu Item 
---------------------
  
  * Toolbar  
    You can Add Edit and Delete [Toolbar](docs/Help/ToolBar.md) with Icon to your application

---------------------
  * Panes  
    You can Design or placed [Pane](docs/Help/Panes.md) in your application
---------------------
  

New Program (How to add)
------------------------

 1. How Connect each [program](docs/Help/Programs.md) to each items
 2. Relationship with [database](docs/Help/Databases.md)

Design Database
---------------

 * Select your engein type
 * SQL Language
 * How Use in source

Add from another source code
----------------------------

* Upload and Create Package
* Downloads and Unpack
* "Fount" Directory

Machine Learning
----------------

1. Design a Panel
2. Add Algorithm
3. Connect to Data
4. Perview Computing
